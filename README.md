# OpenWrt Slovak ISPs

Technical details about internet connection from Slovak ISPs and how to use it with OpenWrt router.

Slovak ISPs tend to push their customers into using ISP-owned router with a monthly fee. Some even require it. This is a terrible practice in my opinion. I started this project to share my experience of using my own OpenWrt-based router with various ISPs.

## ISPs

#### Slovak Telekom
- [Fiber](telekom/fiber)

#### Orange
- [Fiber Partner](orange/fiber-partner)
